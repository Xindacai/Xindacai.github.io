    <!-- These are the category labels located at the top of my webpage. All these texts
     are clickable links, and clicking on them will bring the user to a different page showing
     the products of the specific category they clicked on. My chosen context of a commercial 
     website influenced my decision to apply this design because it creates a more structured, 
     organised and predictable shopping experience for the user by separating all my products 
     into different types. 
     
     This is particularly helpful for users who don't have specific products they want to buy in 
     mind, but just want to browse around for any of the available products, as they would easily 
     tell where to look for different types of products. The feature also aligns with my chosen 
     action of using clicks for navigation and helping the user move between product pages, as 
     clicking on each category reveals extra content for them. -->

   <!-- My website's chosen context of a commercial website and action of using clicks for 
   navigation influeced me to add a search bar to my page. Because it makes the user's 
   shopping experience more convenient as they can click on the search bar and type in 
   keywords which will bring them straight to specific products they want to see. This saves a 
   lot of time for the user as they won't have to look into every single category separately.

    <!-- I added a list of clickable thumbnails showing product photos for each of the categories, 
    with the product names below each thumbnail. The thumbnail list will be shown in the main 
    section of my website's homepage and category pages. Each page has 2 rows of 4 thumbnails, so 
    8 in total. The code above is for the thumbnail list for my Hats category page. 
    
    The top row on the Hats category page will show the caps, while the bottom row show the wide 
    brim hats. That's why I have the subheading "Caps" above the top row of thumbnails, and 
    "Wide Brim" above the bottom row of thumbnails. 

    The users can click on each of those thumbnails, which will bring them to a separate page 
    showing further details of the product they clicked on. This feature aligns with my intention
    of using clicks for navigation and helping the user move between product pages, because 
    clicking on the product will bring users to extra pages, revealing more content to them 
    within the website.  
    
    My chosen context of a commercial website influenced me to apply these layouts and features 
    because they make my webpage look more professional as a shopping site and provide more 
    clarity for the user's shopping experience as they can look at the thumbnails to decide 
    whether they like the product's look before clicking on them for further details and 
    purchase. -->
