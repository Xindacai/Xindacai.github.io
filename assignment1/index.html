  <!-- These 3 lines of text are my heading (first line) and
   subheadings (following two lines). So I chose some fonts that
   look bold and attractive for them and make their text size significantly
   larger so that they could stand out more compared to my
   body texts. In addition, I chose to use a different
   font for each of the three headings just to add a sense
   of playfulness to my webpage design and prevent the
   texts from looking repetitive and boring. -->

<p>Reponse 1</p>

<p>The first thing I paid attention to when interacting 
    with the experience is the artist’s statement paragraph 
    the artist wrote on top of their webpage which introduces 
    who they are and what type of artwork they create. 
    This is the first thing that appears on the webpage after 
    I go inside it. So this is the first thing that caught my eye. 
    The layout and design of this section including the color 
    choices of the paragraph’s texts and the background behind it, 
    and the use of a different font and text size and changing 
    colors on important words in the paragraph for emphasis all 
    demonstrate a high level of creativity and uniqueness.
</p>

<p>It’s interesting how the author applied a color-switch 
    animation to the background in this section, where the 
    background has 4 colors in total: purple, aqua, yellow, 
    and magenta, and depending on where my mouse cursor 
    moves on the screen, one of these colors will show more 
    on the screen while the other 3 show less. What’s more 
    interesting is that as the background color changes, 
    the colors of the texts also change. So they are still 
    visible and would create a good contrast with the background color.
</p>

<p>I also find it entertaining how the keywords in the artist’s 
    statement will also change along with the colors depending 
    on where I move my cursor. This shows the artist is a 
    creative person with lots of ideas in mind.
</p>

<p>How the page looks with all four colors when my cursor is in the middle:</p>
<p><img src="screeshot1.png"></p>

<p>How the background colors, text colors, and keywords in the paragraph change 
depending on where I move my cursor:</p>
<p><img src="screeshot2.png"></p>
<p><img src="screeshot3.png"></p>
<p><img src="screeshot4.png"></p>
<p><img src="screeshot5.png"></p>

<p>Reponse 2</p>
<p>During my two minutes with the experience, my discrete 
    actions were as follows:</p>

<p>Action 1:</p> 
<p>I saw the website's front page with the artist’s statement. 
    I played around with the cursor and saw the color of its 
    text and background and the keywords in the paragraph 
    changed depending on where I moved the cursor on my screen.
</p>

<p>Action 2:</p> 
<p>Scroll down to see another page with a purple background and 
    a white triangle pointing upwards in the middle, and inside 
    the triangle, write three words, “div center Perfectly” 
    from top to bottom. 
</p>

<p><img src="screenshot6.png"alt="What it looks like:" /></p>

<p>But when I moved my cursor below the triangle, the shape 
    and the words inside it performed a smooth animation 
    where the triangle spun to point downwards, and the 
    order of the words from top to bottom also changed to 
    “Perfectly div center”. When I move my cursor above again, 
    the triangle and the words inside it will return to their 
    original position and I spent some time playing with 
    this animation.
</p>

<p><img src="screenshot7.png"alt="Screenshot of how it 
    changed after I moved my cursor:" /></p>

<p>Action 3:</p>
<p>I scrolled further down to the third page with a black 
    background. This page shows a pixel animation design 
    with the title “Pixel Displacement Effect” written 
    in 3D text.</p>

<p><img src="screenshot8.png"alt="Here’s what the texts 
    and the animation look like:" /></p>

<p>I spent some time playing with this animation where 
    the small pixel blocks that built this picture would 
    move away from wherever I moved my cursor. So if I 
    move my cursor to the middle of the picture, it will 
    leave a hole there when the pixel blocks scatter away 
    from my cursor.</p>

<p><img src="screenshot9.png"alt="See screenshot:" /></p>

<p>Action 4:</p>
<p>I scrolled down to the final page of the website where 
    it showed another few lines of text, and I played around 
    with their animations. Each line of text performs a 
    unique animation, where the text colors and the positions 
    of each letter change differently when I put my cursor on 
    each of them.</p>

<p>Action 5:</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the webpage, there are a few lines 
    of text saying “email”, “line” and “LinkedIn” that are 
    clickable links. So I clicked on those links to find 
    the artist’s email address, their QR code for adding 
    friends in the LINE app, and their LinkedIn account 
    page.</p>

<p>Reponse 3</p>
<p>The part of the experience I spent the most time engaging 
    with was the pixel displacement effect. Its title text has a 
    unique layout as every letter in those words is placed in a 
    different angle. This effect presents an image of a painting 
    or perhaps some sort of cartoon work which is built up with a 
    large amount of small pixel blocks. I was fascinated by the 
    high levels of smoothness and fluidity of the pixel animation 
    in this effect. When I move through the picture with my cursor, 
    the pixel blocks that constructed it move away from my cursor 
    quickly and smoothly with no lag.</p>

<p>The speed and distance that the pixel blocks which move away 
    from my cursor also depends on how quickly I move the cursor 
    through the picture. If I move it through slower, the block 
    seems to move away slower but further from my cursor. If I 
    move it through quicker, the block seems to move away faster 
    but less distance away from my cursor. So I spent a lot of 
    time trying to move through the picture with my cursor at 
    different speeds to see how good the animation would look 
    during each attempt.</p>    

<p>Reponse 4</p>
<p>During my two-minute interaction with the experience, my most 
    common action was moving the cursor around or on top of texts 
    or objects that existed throughout the webpage, to repeatedly 
    play around with all of their animations. Through this, I 
    wanted to closely examine how they work and in what exact ways 
    the objects and texts will move around during the animation. 
    Through my repeated attempts at playing with the animations, 
    I wanted to find out whether the direction in which I move my 
    cursor on the screen could make each animation appear differently 
    both in terms of color and movement change.</p>

<p>I also performed this action most commonly through my interaction 
    with the experience because they are the most enjoyable for me 
    and I feel like they are the main attractions for this entire 
    experience.</p>    

<p>Reponse 5</p>
<p>In my impression, the intended primary goal of the interactive 
    experience is just to entertain its users and amaze them with a 
    fancy webpage design filled with bright colors and advanced text 
    and object animations everywhere. The page is very short with only 
    three or four pages and it doesn’t provide useful information about 
    any topics, nor does it have a search function. So it’s clear that 
    this interactive experience is not for any formal uses like learning, 
    education, or research. Therefore, the main purpose of this interactive 
    experience is just a piece of art that intends to make users have a fun 
    time and be attracted by its visual design when using it.</p>

<p>Reponse 6</p>
<p>The interactive experience communicates its primary goal through its 
    design style and structure. Unlike most webpages that are used for 
    educational, shopping, or job-finding purposes which usually have a 
    neat and simple layout with a white background to appear formal. 
    The design of this webpage is very abstract and unpredictable as 
    every page inside it has a completely different style of design and 
    all of their background colors and fonts are different.</p>

<p>In addition, every group of texts and object has their unique animation. 
    This type of design would look very messy on a webpage that has a formal 
    usage, but highly engaging when simply trying to create a piece of art 
    with no intent for practical uses. Through this, the artist of this 
    experience communicates their idea that this webpage is only meant 
    for fun and they only want users to focus on the creative aspects of it 
    rather than any information or content it provides.</p>    

<p>Reponse 7</p>
<p>My impression is that the design encourages ongoing interactions by encouraging 
    its users to try out all of the animations on the texts, shapes, and objects 
    that are present throughout the webpage and experiment with how they could 
    make each animation appear slightly different in terms of color change or 
    movement depending on the different actions (e.g. moving their cursors in 
    different directions) they perform on the assets.</p>

<p>The interactive experience is mainly designed for short-term or one-time 
    engagement rather than long-term because its content is too short with 
    only around three pages and doesn’t provide any useful information. 
    So the users might appreciate the creative design of this interactive 
    experience when they first access it, but this experience wouldn’t be 
    useful in the long term as it is not designed to assist users in their 
    daily lives or work, but purely for one-time entertainment.</p>    

<p>Reponse 8</p>
<p>The website’s mechanisms and features are attractive to the users, 
    but they generally don’t encourage users to return or engage with them 
    repeatedly. While its animations are fun to play with, the website isn’t 
    designed to help its users in any aspect of their daily lives or make 
    them improve at any skill. So there isn’t any need for users to repeatedly 
    engage with it regularly.</p>

<p>In addition, unlike websites that would save users’ progress or track their 
    past activities and provide them with new content based on these records 
    every time the users log back on, the content on this website always stays 
    the same. So while the users might find its features interesting for the first 
    time, they will eventually get bored.</p>    

<p>Reponse 9</p>
<p>
  A media form that the experience may reference is this 
  website: <a href="https://www.luni.app/Career" target="_blank">https://www.luni.app/Career</a>
</p>

<p>Just like my chosen website, this website also includes a lot of objects or 
   texts with animations that only show up when I hover my cursor over them. 
   Similar to the pixel diffusion artwork in my chosen website where I can 
   make its pixel particles move in different directions by hovering my cursor 
   over them, the referencing website also has a 3D asset on its front page 
   which I can control its movement with my cursor, like the direction it 
   rotates in. In addition, both websites include clickable links that are 
   disguised as words.</p>    

<p>Reponse 10</p>
<p>This media reference guides user behavior within the interactive experience 
    as it encourages the users to explore the experience with curiosity and a 
    desire to uncover hidden features by putting their cursors on every available 
    shape, text, asset, or even background present in the website. Because every 
    one of them could potentially have a hidden animation that will play when 
    it’s activated through user interaction.</p>

<p>Reponse 11</p>
<p>The emotional responses that the media work is intended to evoke in the user 
    are surprise, excitement, and curiosity. Because it has a creative visual design, 
    especially on its main page that would be highly attractive for the users, as the 
    colors of its texts, objects, and background blend in very well with each other. 
    In addition, the unpredictable mechanism of the website would be fun for users to 
    play with because every asset in it could perform stunning animations or bring the 
    users to a different page when being clicked on.</p>

<p>Reponse 12</p>
<p>The most frustrating part of the interaction is the second page of the website with 
    a purple background and a white triangle asset in the middle with the words “div, 
    center, Perfectly” inside the shape. The animation in this part is meant to reverse 
    the triangle upside down as well as the order of the three words from top to bottom. 
    However, my interaction with these assets to make the animation play did not go 
    smoothly because during a few of the times when I moved my cursor up or down the 
    assets to try and activate the animation, it simply didn’t work and I had to give 
    it multiple attempts for the animation to play itself.</p>

<p>Reponse 13</p>
<p>The most satisfying part of the interaction is the section of the website with an 
   artwork created by the pixel diffusion effect. I had a fun time playing and 
   interacting with the pixel particles of this effect. I found it satisfying to see 
   the pixel particles moving away as I moved my cursor across them and broke a hole 
   in the artwork, then see those pixel particles slowly flow back to where they 
   originally were after my cursor had gone past them.</p>
