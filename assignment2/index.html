<!-- I added a call to action function to the words "Listen Now" and made it a clickable 
link which directly links to the "tracklist" text that is included in the #tracks section below, 
by using the hypertext reference command. I did this so it will be more convient for the user 
to get to the main content of my webpage straight away from the title area without having to 
scroll down manually. Because below the "tracklist" text will be a list of my playable music 
tracks which are the website's main focus as it is a music album. -->

<!-- This is the cover photo for my music album and I made this using Canva. The layout of
my website is inspired by the layout and design of Spotify's playlist section which also 
includes an album cover and playlist name I at the very top of the page. That's why I chose 
to include an album cover right below the title and author texts of my website, and made its
size quite large. Because this way, the cover will be the become the first thing that the user
will see when they go into my website, just like in Spotify's playlist page. This makes the 
website more attractive as it has a visually engaging image at the very top. -->    
  
<!-- In the layout of my website, I made sure the album cover art at the top is clearly separated
from my playlist below. This will create a visual hierarchy which guides the user's eye from 
artwork to interactions as they scroll down from the top. --> ????

<!-- Each of these audio tracks in this tracklist include the track's name and cover, 
a play and pause button for control, and a draggable progress bar that can take the 
user to any section inside the audio track depending on where the user drags it. 
These are mainly inspired by YouTube video and Spotify playlist interfaces. 
These controls offer minimal distraction while fulfilling the requirement for contextual 
interactivity as a music album. --> ????

    <h2>About the Album</h2>
    <p>This album explores a list of my favourite music tracks from various artists. 
    All of these tracks will give either a relaxed or ominous feeling.</p>
  </section>
    <!-- I included a description of this album under the tracklist showing all of my audio tracks 
    to make my music album apepar more professional as well as providing more clarity to my
    users about what types of music the album provides. I think this is a good way to engage 
    my users emotionally as they scroll to the bottom of the website. -->
