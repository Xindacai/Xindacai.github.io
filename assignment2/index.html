    <h1>Music Album</h1>

    <a href="#tracks" class="cta-btn">Listen Now</a>
<!-- I added a call to action function to the words "Listen Now" and made it a clickable 
link which will link to the "tracklist" text below by using the hypertext reference 
command with the #tracks element. I did this so it will be more convient for the user to get to the
main content of my webpage straight away from the title area without having to scroll down manually. 
Because below the "tracklist" text will be a list of my playable music tracks which are the 
website's main focus as it is a music album. -->

<!-- This is the cover photo for my music album and I made this using Canva. The layout of
my website is inspired by the layout and design of Spotify's playlist section which also 
includes an album cover and playlist name I at the very top of the page. That's why I chose 
to include an album cover right below the title and author texts of my website, and made its
size quite large. Because this way, the cover will be the become the first thing that the user
will see when they go into my website, just like in Spotify's playlist page. This makes the 
website more attractive as it has a visually engaging image at the very top. -->    
  
    <!--
      TRACKLIST STRUCTURE:
      Each track includes a dynamic audio element, a button for control, and a range input
      that functions as a draggable progress bar — inspired by YouTube and Spotify interfaces.
      These controls offer minimal distraction while fulfilling the requirement for contextual interactivity.

    ABOUT SECTION:
    This brief artist note grounds the site in narrative — which was discussed in class as a
    way to emotionally engage users through storytelling. It breaks up the media interactions
    with slower, readable content for accessibility.
