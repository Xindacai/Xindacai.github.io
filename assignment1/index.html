  <!-- These 3 lines of text are my heading (first line) and
   subheadings (following two lines). So I chose some fonts that
   look bold and attractive for them and make their text size significantly
   larger so that they could stand out more compared to my
   body texts. In addition, I chose to use a different
   font for each of the three headings just to add a sense
   of playfulness to my webpage design and prevent the
   texts from looking repetitive and boring. -->

<p>My chosen web project: https://palat2023.com/</p>
<p>Analysis Reponses:</p>
<p>Reponse 1</p>
<p>The first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the experience is the artist’s statement paragraph the artist wrote on top of their webpage which introduces who they are and what type of artwork they create. This is the first thing that appears on the webpage after I go inside it. So this is the first thing that caught my eye. The layout and design of this section including the color choices of the paragraph’s texts and the background behind it, and the use of a different font and text size and changing colors on important words in the paragraph for emphasis all demonstrate a high level of creativity and uniqueness.
</p>
<p>It’s interesting how the author applied a color-switch animation to the background in this section, where the background has 4 colors in total: purple, aqua, yellow, and magenta, and depending on where my mouse cursor moves on the screen, one of these colors will show more on the screen while the other 3 show less. What’s more interesting is that as the background color changes, the colors of the texts also change. So they are still visible and would create a good contrast with the background color.
</p>
<p>I also find it entertaining how the keywords in the artist’s statement will also change along with the colors depending on where I move my cursor. This shows the artist is a creative person with lots of ideas in mind.
</p>

<p>Reponse 2</p>
<p>During my two minutes with the experience, my discrete actions were as follows:</p>

<p>Action 1:</p> 
<p>I saw the website's front page with the artist’s statement. I played around with the cursor and saw the color of its text and background and the keywords in the paragraph changed depending on where I moved the cursor on my screen.
</p>

<p>Action 2:</p> 
<p>Scroll down to see another page with a purple background and a white triangle pointing upwards in the middle, and inside the triangle, write three words, “div center Perfectly” from top to bottom. 
</p>
<p>But when I moved my cursor below the triangle, the shape and the words inside it performed a smooth animation where the triangle spun to point downwards, and the order of the words from top to bottom also changed to “Perfectly div center”. When I move my cursor above again, the triangle and the words inside it will return to their original position and I spent some time playing with this animation.
</p>

<p>Action 3:</p>
<p>I scrolled further down to the third page with a black background. This page shows a pixel animation design with the title “Pixel Displacement Effect” written in 3D text.</p>
<p>I spent some time playing with this animation where the small pixel blocks that built this picture would move away from wherever I moved my cursor. So if I move my cursor to the middle of the picture, it will leave a hole there when the pixel blocks scatter away from my cursor.</p>

<p>Action 4:</p>
<p>I scrolled down to the final page of the website where it showed another few lines of text, and I played around with their animations. Each line of text performs a unique animation, where the text colors and the positions of each letter change differently when I put my cursor on each of them.</p>

<p>Action 5:</p>
<p>At the very bottom of the webpage, there are a few lines of text saying “email”, “line” and “LinkedIn” that are clickable links. So I clicked on those links to find the artist’s email address, their QR code for adding friends in the LINE app, and their LinkedIn account page.</p>
