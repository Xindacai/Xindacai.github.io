<!-- I imported the 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts because it looks simple, modern, and clean,
so it is easily readable and fits well with the simplistic design of my website in general.  
The font also looks similar to the font used in Spotify playlists. So, this font will give 
the website a contemporary, digital media look. Which is just what I need for the aesthetics 
in the context of a music album. --> 

<!-- I will only stick to this font throughout my entire website and not add anymore new fonts.
Because only relying on one font helps my website maintain a sense of visual consistency and
prevents visual distractions from happening to the user. This way, my users can keep their focus
solely on my website's music and layout, which is the core focus of this website as a music album. Rather
than focusing on random visual design changes. 

In addition, professional music platforms like Spotify, Apple
Music and YouTube Music all use a single font style across their interfaces. Since my music album
website is mainly inspired by the design of Spotify's playlist page; I also want my website's
design to follow that rule of consistency, to create a sense of order and predictability. -->

<!-- I added a call to action function to the words "Listen Now" and made it a clickable 
link that directly links to the "tracklist" text that is included in the #tracks section below, 
by using the hypertext reference command. I did this so it will be more convenient for the user 
to get to the main content of my webpage straight away from the title area without having to 
scroll down manually. Below the "tracklist" text will be a list of my playable music 
tracks, which are the website's main focus as it is a music album. -->

<!-- This is the cover photo for my music album, and I made this using Canva. The layout of
my website is inspired by the layout and design of Spotify's playlist section, which also 
includes an album cover and playlist name at the very top of the page. That's why I chose 
to include an album cover right below the title and author texts of my website, and made its
size quite large. Because this way, the cover will be the first thing that the user
will see when they go into my website, just like in Spotify's playlist page. This makes the 
website more attractive as it has a visually engaging image at the very top. -->    
  
<!-- In the layout of my website, I made sure the album cover art at the top looks clearly separated
from my playlist below. This will create a visual hierarchy that guides the user's eye from 
artwork to interactions as they scroll down from the top. -->

<!-- Each of these audio tracks in this tracklist includes the track's cover on the left 
(made in Canva) and track's name on the right, a play and pause button for control, and a 
draggable progress bar that can take the user to any section inside the audio track's duration, depending on where the user drags it. These are mainly inspired by YouTube videos and Spotify 
playlist interfaces. These functionalities that I included for the audio tracks will fulfill 
the requirement for the website's contextual interactivity as a music album. -->

<!-- I also added timestamps on both sides of my progress bars for each audio track. Because
I'm designing this website in the context of a music album, and all professional music apps
like Spotify and Apple Music would have this feature for their playlists. Adding timestamps
will give my users more clarity on where they are in the duration of my audio track as they 
drag the progress bar around, as well as how much time the music has left in its whole duration. -->

  <section class="about">
    <h2>About the Album</h2>
    <h3>This album explores a list of my favourite music tracks from various artists. 
    All of these tracks will give either a relaxed or ominous feeling.</h3>
  </section>
    <!-- I included a description of this album under the tracklist, showing all of my audio tracks 
    to make my music album appear more professional, as well as providing more clarity to my
    users about what types of music the album provides. I think this is a good way to engage 
    my users emotionally as they scroll to the bottom of the website. -->
    </main>
    <!-- I aligned all my body texts in this website to the left because in a music album,
    it would look weird to have all texts centred in the middle. I feel like it looks neater
    and makes more sense to align the body texts to the side in a playlist webpage, even though
    aligning everything right in the middle might be more suitable when designing a website for
    general use. -->
