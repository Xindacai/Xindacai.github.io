    <a href="#tracks" class="cta-btn">Listen Now</a>
<!-- I added a call to action function to the words "Listen Now" and made it a clickable 
link which will link to the "tracklist" text below by using the hypertext reference 
command with the #tracks element. I did this so it will be more convient for the user to get to the
main content of my webpage straight away from the title area without having to scroll down manually. 
Because below the "tracklist" text will be a list of my playable music tracks which are the 
website's main focus as it is a music album. -->

<!-- This is the cover photo for my music album and I made this using Canva. The layout of
my website is inspired by the layout and design of Spotify's playlist section which also 
includes an album cover and playlist name I at the very top of the page. That's why I chose 
to include an album cover right below the title and author texts of my website, and made its
size quite large. Because this way, the cover will be the become the first thing that the user
will see when they go into my website, just like in Spotify's playlist page. This makes the 
website more attractive as it has a visually engaging image at the very top. -->

<!-- Each of these audio tracks in this tracklist include the track's name and cover, a play and pause 
 button for control, and a range input that functions as a draggable progress bar. These are mainly inspired by 
 YouTube video and Spotify playlist interfaces. These controls offer minimal distraction while fulfilling 
 the requirement for contextual interactivity as a music album . -->

    <h2>About the Album</h2>
    <p>This album explores a list of my favourite music tracks from various artists. 
    All of these tracks will give either a relaxed or ominous feeling.</p>
  </section>
    <!-- I included a description of this album under the tracklist showing all of my audio tracks 
    to make my music album apepar more professional as well as providing more clarity to my
    users about what types of music the album provides. I think this is a good way to engage 
    my users emotionally as they scroll to the bottom of the website. -->
